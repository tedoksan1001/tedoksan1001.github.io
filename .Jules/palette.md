## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Educational Content]
**Learning:** In educational pages with scientific notation (like chemical formulas), raw text or LaTeX-style strings without a renderer create a poor UX. Using semantic HTML <sub> tags is a simple but highly effective micro-UX win for readability.
**Action:** Always check for and fix unrendered mathematical or chemical notation in static pages.

## 2025-05-15 - [Localization and Accessibility]
**Learning:** ARIA labels must match the document's language for a consistent screen reader experience.
**Action:** When working on non-English pages, provide localized ARIA labels (e.g., Turkish for 'Menüyü aç/kapat').
